# What is it for?

Those Jupyter Notebook are designed for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It includes various sections that cover data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The notebook is structured to guide users through the process of handling text data, applying NLP techniques. Key components typically include:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load text data and preprocess it for analysis, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods to convert text data into numerical features, such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models on the processed text data, including algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the results and insights from the NLP tasks, such as word clouds, confusion matrices, and performance plots.

This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for users looking to apply NLP techniques to their text data and gain insights.
